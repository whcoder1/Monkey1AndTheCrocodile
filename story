Once upon a time there lived a monkey in the forest who rested on a jamun tree,which was on the banks of a river .In the same forest 
,there lived a crocodile and his wife....the kindhearted monkey offered some jamuns to the crocodile .the crocodile came back the 
next day for more fruits .As the days passed they both became very good friends
